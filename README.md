## Description

With this challenge I created a local backend application with mongoose DB where the routes get tested in Insomnia.

## Installation

You need to install:

- `Node`

- `Express`

- `Mongoose`

- `Inquirer`

You need to have these downloaded to your machine:

- Mongo Compass

- Insomnia

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local machine through either your terminal (MacOS) or git bash (Windows). cd into the new folder and type `code .` and the project will automatically launch in VSCode (or any coding software of your choice).

Run `npm install` in the CLI.

Run `node server.js` in the CLI to start the server and plug the routes into Insomnia.
